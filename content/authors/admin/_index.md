I'm an aquatic ecologist primarily interested in using data science to better understand the natural world. I currently work at PhycoTech, an environmental laboratory focused on freshwater algal analysis. My day-to-day consists of processing samples, programming, and doing environmental outreach throughout southwestern Michigan.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time exploring the outdoors, cooking, and building open-source tools for environmental analysis.
