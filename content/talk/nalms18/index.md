abstract: Reservoirs are unique aquatic systems as they exhibit both lotic and lentic characteristics across a longitudinal gradient.  The process in which a reservoir transitions from a riverine to a lacustrine system has implications on the physical, chemical, and biological conditions throughout the reservoir.  Since 1998, the Indiana Clean Lakes Program (InCLP) has monitored Lake Lemon, a 1,650-acre reservoir located near Bloomington, Indiana.  Sampling was conducted during the growing season (May-August) for each year at sites located across the longitudinal gradient of the reservoir.  In this study, I will use the long-term monitoring data to summarize water quality changes for Lake Lemon over two decades and identify if the sampling sites illustrate a longitudinal gradient in the reservoir.  The results of this study will contribute to the overall understanding of the various limnological processes influencing water quality in Lake Lemon, and the importance of sampling design when monitoring reservoirs.
