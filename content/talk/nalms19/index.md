abstract: Lake water quality monitoring programs have historically communicated results through traditional methods like written reports and presentations.  While these methods may effectively communicate information to a targeted group, they often fail to reach all stakeholders interested in lake water quality.  Recent advancements in web-based and open source technologies provide programs with the ability to not only reach a larger group of stakeholders, but to allow for individuals to view data in an interactive and customizable way.  The Indiana Clean Lakes Program is a multifaceted water monitoring and educational program incorporating both annual monitoring and citizen science to assess Indiana lake water quality.  The Indiana Clean Lakes Program has sampled over 2000 lakes since 1989 through annual monitoring, and currently includes over 80 volunteer lake monitors.  This talk will illustrate how the program has used Esri Story Maps and Shiny from R Studio to build interactive web-based maps and visualizations displaying these data to stakeholders across Indiana.
