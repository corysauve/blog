I’ve wanted to improve my online precence for awhile now and\nhave finally sat down and made a website. I created and am maintaining this site via the R blogdown package and Hugo. You can check out my GitHub repo if your interested in the use\nof blogdown to make static websites.\nMy goal for this site is to accomplish two things: first to serve as a medium for which I can start bloggging my programming endevours relating to my work and random things that interest me, as well as to serve as a digitial resume and portfolio. I’m hoping to have a new post up every week. Now that it’s football season again, expect some fantasy football analysis in R and Python (yes, this is what I do on the weekends for fun).\nAnyway, thanks for visiting my site!\n– Cory\n","date":1566604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566692210,"objectID":"7c1eacd5a8dcaed9369153e3019cced6","permalink":"/post/welcome-to-my-website/","publishdate":"2019-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome-to-my-website/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to my site!","tags":[],"title":"Inaugural Post","type":"post"},{"authors":["Cory Sauve"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553184000,"objectID":"7f4ed83025e6a5434b06b725bc261876","permalink":"/talk/ilms19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ilms19/","section":"talk","summary":"Technical report presented at the 31st Annual Indiana Lakes Management Society Conference, Syracuse, IN.","tags":["water quality","lake management"],"title":"A story of Indiana lakes through data - The Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015 to 2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
