&lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking out my site! I’ve wanted to improve my online precence for awhile now and&lt;br /&gt;
have finally sat down and made a website. I created and am maintaining this site via the R &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; package and Hugo. You can check out my GitHub repo if your interested in the use&lt;br /&gt;
of &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; to make static websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal for this site is to accomplish two things: first to serve as a medium for which I can start bloggging my programming endevours relating to my work and random things that interest me, as well as to serve as a digitial resume and portfolio. I’m hoping to have a new post up every week. Now that it’s football season again, expect some fantasy football analysis in R and Python (yes, this is what I do on the weekends for fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for visiting my site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Cory&lt;/p&gt;
